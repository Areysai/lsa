Disk Partitioning in Linux using FDISK :
----------------------------------------

To list all the list of partitions on all the hdds attached to a machine
# fdisk -l

To list all the partitions on a specific hdd
# fdisk -l <Device_name>
ex : # fdisk -l /dev/sda

Managing partitions on a hdd using FDISK utility:
-------------------------------------------------

Disk layout:
	Disk layout contains 3 type of partitions.
	We can create 4 partitions on a disk according to the type of partitions.
	
	-Primary
	-Extended
		-Logical
	
	According to the above layout we can  create 4 partitions on a disk which is a total of Primary.
	To overcome this design problem, extended partitions were invented. This trick allows partitioning a primary partition into sub-partitions.	
	The primary partition thus subdivided is the extended partition; the sub-partitions are logical partitions.
	They behave like primary partitions, but are created differently.
	There is no speed difference between them.
	By using an extended partition you can now have up to 15 partitions per disk.
